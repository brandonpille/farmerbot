# farmerbot
The farmerbot is an optional tool a farmer can run that will do capacity planning and power management for its nodes.

## Requirements
As the tool is written in [V] being able to build [V] code is the first requirement. [V] is still fairly new, therefore it is recommended to install [V] from source. You can find guidelines [here](https://github.com/vlang/v#installing-v-from-source). We also highly recommend you to read [V's documentation][doc_V] if you're new to the language.
